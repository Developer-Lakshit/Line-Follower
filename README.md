# The Line Follower Bot
<br>
Aim of the project is to create a fast moving Line follower bot based on PID algorithm.
<br>
It consist of three branches:-
<br>
1.Structure
<br>
2.Electronics
<br>
3.Programming
<br>
<br>
Structure includes the dimensions of chasis,allocation of space for different electronic components.The main aim is to take turns easily and fasly.
<br>
<br>
Electronics includes assembly and connection of microcontroller with motor driver, motors, IR sensor , battery.
<br>
<br>
Programming includes configuration of microcontroller that we are using in our project. this is the most easiest as well as tricky step because here we need to apply PID.
